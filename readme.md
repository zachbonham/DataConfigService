Yet Another Configuration Service
=================================
This time using WCF Data Service and OData.  For kicks, I also threw in a ASP.NET dynamic data web site for administration to see what thats like, but I doubt I'd  use it.  In the sample here I'm storing configuration strings, but you could store anything (wcf bindings, contracts, addresses, etc).

For another configuration service implementation, see [squirrel](https://github.com/zachbonham/squirrel).
